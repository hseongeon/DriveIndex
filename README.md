Purpose:
    DriveIndex is a command-line tool that scans external drives to index directory
    and file information, helping users keep track of where their data is stored.
    It is designed for collections where data does not change frequently. Once indexed,
    users can search for directories and files by name and see which drive they
    belong to, even without connecting the drive, making large collections of data
    easier to manage.
